This is one of (if not) the BEST banana cake I have ever tasted! I thought the oven temp of 275° sounded a little low,
but this cake baked up (and rose) beautifully in my oven at this temp after pretty much exactly one hour. 
I do not know if the little "freezer
trick" to this recipe is what ensured its moistness or not, but I did it,
and it was exceptionally moist & delicious. Would be interesting to see if
it still came out as great if this step was skipped. All I know is that I
followed this recipe EXACTLY as stated (except that I had no buttermilk, so I
subbed with a mix of lemon juice & milk) and I got exceptional results. So
moist and yummy...a dense cake, similar in texture to a carrot cake... I
personally would not call this frosted banana bread :o) Depending on the amount
of frosting you like you can decide whether to half the recipe or not. I used
the full recipe and had some leftover. I sprinkled on the chopped walnuts and
threw this baby in the fridge and cut it the next day...TO DIE FOR! I really
liked it slightly chilled, but great at room temp too! It got better each day
it sat, I always make this cake at least the day before I need or want it. I
was extremely pleased with this cake and will be making it over & over
again!! So glad I came across this one!! (on another website). (* * Just to
update the recipe, (based on some of the reviews), the baking time may vary
based on individual ovens. It was RIGHT ON for my oven, but some others have
stated it has taken 1 hour 10 minutes, 1 hour 20 minutes, and my sister just
informed me that it took 1 hour 30 minutes in her oven!!!!!)
