  Dillard Mill

It rained all night. The day rose dripping grey.
The cool air, welcome after summer’s heat
Smelled finally like fall. The first red flames
Of sumac bushes shone beside the street.

At noon, the mill pond mirrored clouds on blue.
The Huzzah Creek splashed sparkles off the falls.
The solid mill stood watching silently,
Machines asleep inside behind red walls.

The buckeye trees, already bare of leaves,
Had strewn their shiny fruit across the ground.
And I collected, joyful as a child,
The great brown treasure: chestnuts, smooth and round.

 <h2 id="information">Cai's Food webpage</h2>
 <p>
  Welcome to my homepage. 
  My name is Guangyuan Cai, I decided to build this web page is because I like to eat and cook. 
  My favorite color is blue, and for now, my favorite song is the Chainsmokers’ closer. 
  I select some recipes from food.com website, food network. Com and lecremedelacrumb.com website.
  I select those recipes because I already tried the recipes and think it’s delicious. 
  The first recipe is banana cake with cream cheese frosting. 
  My favorite cheese is cream cheese, and it does not contain really high calorie. 
  Banana cake is also easy to cook. I select this recipe is because it’s not really sweet, taste soft, and smell great. 
  The second receiptI put into the web page is lemon chicken and asparagus foil pack. 
  It’s also easy to cook, only about 30 minutes, don’t have lots of tricks, and the most important point is that it’s really healthy.
  Later on, I will add noodle recipe, soup recipe, and some other countries food recipes. 
  If you want some specific recipes you can contact me, and I can find some recipes for you. 
  Additional, I may recommend some restaurant I already ate, and like. Hope you guys can find the recipes you want.

This is one of (if not) the BEST banana cake I have ever tasted! I thought the oven temp of 275° sounded a little low,
but this cake baked up (and rose) beautifully in my oven at this temp after pretty much exactly one hour. 
I do not know if the little "freezer
trick" to this recipe is what ensured its moistness or not, but I did it,
and it was exceptionally moist & delicious. Would be interesting to see if
it still came out as great if this step was skipped. All I know is that I
followed this recipe EXACTLY as stated (except that I had no buttermilk, so I
subbed with a mix of lemon juice & milk) and I got exceptional results. So
moist and yummy...a dense cake, similar in texture to a carrot cake... I
personally would not call this frosted banana bread :o) Depending on the amount
of frosting you like you can decide whether to half the recipe or not. I used
the full recipe and had some leftover. I sprinkled on the chopped walnuts and
threw this baby in the fridge and cut it the next day...TO DIE FOR! I really
liked it slightly chilled, but great at room temp too! It got better each day
it sat, I always make this cake at least the day before I need or want it. I
was extremely pleased with this cake and will be making it over & over
again!! So glad I came across this one!! (on another website). (* * Just to
update the recipe, (based on some of the reviews), the baking time may vary
based on individual ovens. It was RIGHT ON for my oven, but some others have
stated it has taken 1 hour 10 minutes, 1 hour 20 minutes, and my sister just
informed me that it took 1 hour 30 minutes in her oven!!!!!)

Foil packs just take the cake when it comes to easy,
delicious meals. No pans to scrub, no dishes to wash, and if you are really dedicated
to making your dinner-life a walk in the park you could even use plastic
forks and knives so they can go straight into the garbage along with your
used-up foil, absolutely no cleaning required.
Unless you are my mother in law who hand washes plastic ware
and saves it for another day.
Simple lemon chicken & asparagus foil packs are an easy
and incredibly delicious 30-minute meal you can either grill, or bake any time
of the year.

Recipe type: Main Dish


Cuisine: American


Serves: 4

 </p>
 <p class="test1">
Ingredients



 4
     boneless skinless chicken breasts pounded to even thickness, OR 6-8
     boneless skinless chicken thighs (see note)
 1
     large bundle of asparagus spears (about 1 pound)
 1 lemon,
     divided
 1
     teaspoon minced garlic
 3
     tablespoons butter, melted
 1½
     teaspoons Italian seasoning
 salt
     and pepper to taste

 </p>
 
<p>

Instructions 


1.Lay four 12x12 inch squares of foil out on a flat surface.
Place one chicken breasts (or 1-2 thighs) in the middle of each piece of foil.


2.Trim the flat end of the asparagus at 1-2 inches from the
end and discard. Cut the remaining spears in half and divided them between the
foil packs.


3.Thinly slice one of the lemons and divide the slices
between the foil packs, tucking the slices in, around, and between the chicken
and asparagus.


4.Stir together butter, garlic, juice of the remaining
lemon, and Italian seasoning. Brush over chicken and asparagus. Sprinkle with
salt and pepper to taste.


5.Fold the foil over the chicken and asparagus to close off
the pack, pinch the ends together so the pack stays closed.


6.Grill over medium-high heat for 7-9 minutes on each side
OR bake at 400 for 15-20 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and
asparagus is tender. Serve immediately.

Notes 


Chicken thighs tend to be smaller than most chicken breasts
so if you are going to use thighs, use 1-2 depending on the size of the thigh -
for smaller, you'll probably want two in a single foil pack, if they are larger
you could get away with using one in a foil pack. Just remember each pack is
for one person so you want as much chicken as will fill that person!
